So lately I’ve been playing around with Ansible, what I find to be a fantastic provisioning tool for servers.  But then an idea struck me, if I could talk to “any” ip with ansible, then, doesn’t that me I can talk to myself!?  So I set up a github repository that you can reference and build on to talk to your localhost.
